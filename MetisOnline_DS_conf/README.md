*ques: How to choose algor or area of study to practice before interview?*
Look at what is required of junior data scientist, math and stats foundation. and the attitude and potential to learn.
it depends on the company and the role.During phone interview w/ recruiter try and understand the nature of the data and their main problems. Also - look into background of the team members on LinkedIn (seeing their focus can sometimes hint at what they test for)

Also - Glassdoor.com has interview questions often

 I would focus more on the company. Do research on them. Whats their product? What does their Data Science team look like? And then match that with what you are most familiar with

Excellent! But yes, in almost every situation the employers I talk to know the job posting is almost asking for too much (and in fact they sometimes make them intentionally high-level to reduce the number of applicants)

**questions**:
VISUALIZTION IS IMPORTANT


 Approach people with a curious mindset. It's more about learning what they do and asking good Q's - that will have people engage by sharing what they are doing and show you are interested. You don't need to know everything
 in absence of relevant experience, I would heavily emphasize projects you have developed.Building a portfolio Data projects is the best leverage to show your value if you can't lean on employment to showcase those things
