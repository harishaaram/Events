# Last talk
*@2:00 (2:15 PM) Panel Discussion: Ethics, Fairness, and Bias*
Lisa Green (Domino)
Nathan Srebro (TTIC)
Julia Stoyanovich (Drexel University)

What values to include to address the bias?
*julia*
- Not the judge of what is right oor wrong
- Big algorithmic descion making problems is to think about the policy maker to decide which is right or wrong.

*Nathan*
- dont hear from the policy makers,
- tradeoff with accruarcy and not great a social problem
- what is it you want fro the system

*Lisa*
- what do you want from the systems
- bring public into your decision

*julia*
-what kind of systems do you want?
- systems innovlving people and data and technology
- Data extraction + data cleaning + data filtering(of our concern) -> then data analysis

*Nathan*
- How do you make the result intrepretable? what is it means intrepreatablity?
- two diff : intrepreatablity of data and predictinve outcoe
- transprerancy; ie what my model does, parameters etc... ect... but that doesn't say what it actually does--it works statistically good but not intrepredable

*Julia*
- transparancy and intrepretability: according to her:
- waka

HOW MUCH DO YOU TRUST THE OPEN SOURCE DATA?:
- TAKING THE OUTPUT and models

- WHY DID THE ALGO MADE THIS OUTPUT? HARD TO ANS	
- 

to learn: **Probalistic methods, statistics, understand the basis of these to the core!**

**causal effect: cmu qiu**[cmu algo transparency via quantitative input influence](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/danupam/datta-sen-zick-oakland16.pdf)

**code of ethics newyourk**

Note: removing race doen't mean that your model is not correlated to race specific
even correlated values have significance.
