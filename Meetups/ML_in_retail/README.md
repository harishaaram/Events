## Talk #1: Deploying Data Science: A Blueprint for Success by Ken Sanford, Analytics Architect at Dataiku
Deploying data science projects is difficult for any organization. For retailers looking to compete with the disruptive forces of Amazon, Jet and other data science-first retailers, the successful deployment of data science projects is imperative to their long-term success. In this talk, we will discuss people and process strategies to quickly prototype and deploy data science at scale. We will discuss several strategies of data science team building and several alternative methods of deployment. The talk will close with a detailed description how a current customer builds and deploys product recommendations as a REST API.

Ken is the US Lead Analytics Architect for Dataiku. He is a reformed academic economist who likes to empower customers to solve problems with data. Kenâ€™s primary passion is teaching and explaining. He likes to simplify and tell stories. Ken has spent time in academia (Middle Tennessee State University, U of Cincinnati, Boston College) consulting (Deloitte) and software development (SAS, H2O). He has a Ph.D. in Economics from the University of Kentucky in Lexington and his work on price optimization has been published in peer-reviewed journals.

## Talk #2: Using PySpark at ShopRunner by Ali Vanderveld, Lead Data Scientist at ShopRunner

Apache Spark is a powerful framework for the distributed processing of large datasets. Ali is going to discuss how ShopRunner's data team uses the Spark Python API (aka PySpark). This includes the pros, the cons, and some tricks learned along the way. Ali will walk through a real-world example wherein they infer attributes of millions of clothing items - for instance, whether or not they are for children - from the text of their names and descriptions.

Ali Vanderveld is currently a Lead Data Scientist at ShopRunner. Previously she has worked at Civis Analytics, as a technical mentor for the Data Science for Social Good Fellowship, at Groupon, and as an academic astrophysicist.
