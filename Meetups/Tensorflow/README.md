# Tensorflow object detection - workshop

## Intro by Garrett
1. Ec2 - GPU; ssh
	why: pre config settings
2. tmux(?)
3. Bounding boxes with high *confidence Intervals*
4. There is lot more than training and validating...problem is with data cleansing and data accusation


## Keras by Rajiv:
1. 


## After Break:
## Garrett:
1. Tensorboard



## After Lunch:
## Raj:
1. CNNs for object detection
2. what is the size of the bounding box...
3. R-CNN
4. Fast R-CNN


## Garrett:
1. what is Finetunning: reusing the pretrained model and tuniing it...
2. Epoch...imp for DS

Notes:
1. build a wrapper function for your project - NewsOptimism
2. contributed to the kaggle community
3. EAD
4. Pretrained model - pickle/ forzen graph in tensorflow
